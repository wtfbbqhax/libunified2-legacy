I developed this library from 2010 through 2012. Over the years, I had forgotten about this project;
I thought it was gone forever, until *dun-dun-duuuun* I found it! Living on an old harddrive that I
often treated like a coaster.

The code was designed to mimic the API of libarchive-2.x.x. The code is very flexible in regard to
"how" you want to open the unified2 logs: file descriptor, FILE stream or even raw memory buffer/length. 
After opening a log file, you iterate over all the records- all the tricky stuff is handled internally.

tl;dr

Just take a look at this demo application, it explains it better.
